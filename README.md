## PathFinder

PathFinder is a light web app that demonstrates path finding when the computer is aware of the state of the entire grid.

### Instructions

Clone the project into your local directory, then run npm start or yarn start. Open up your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the project.

When you first run the app, a 10x10 grid is generated with a starting square highlighted in Green and an ending square highlighted in Red. You can click the other squares to construct a maze for the computer to try to solve.

When you've created your maze (and you're sure you haven't blocked the path completely), click start to watch the algorithm in action.
